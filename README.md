# NTU Downdetector

## Description

#### Problem

There is no centralized platform to check the status of services at NTU. Inspired by downdetector, the goal is to create a platform for real time user reports of student issues such as internet connection, printer up-time etc. This allows users to have easy access to whether a problem has occurred while also giving the relevant administrators the ability to quickly rectify a problem.
