# NTU Downdetector

## Description

#### Problem
There is no centralized platform to check the current internet status at NTU halls. Inspired by downdetector, the goal is to create a platform for real time user reports of student issues such as internet connectivity. This allows users to determine whether the problem is local or server-side, while also giving the relevant administrators the ability to quickly determine if there is an issue.
